<center><h1>The UNIX Operating System</h1></center>

The following is a (very) brief summary of the UNIX (or Linux)
Operating System.  It describes a small subset of the commands
available under the shells sh (or its linux version, bash) and csh (or
tcsh, an extended version of csh). These shells offer a convenient
syntax for executing interactive commands.  The command structure in
bash is in many ways more powerful, and is particularly useful in
writing scripts where efficiency is important.  <p>

</p><h2> The File System </h2>

In UNIX (and Linux), physical disks are divided into logical
``partitions'' (blocks of space of specific size) with the
<b>format</b> command.  A <i>file system</i> is then imposed on these
partitions, allowing a directory structure to exist.  Directories
(``folders'' in Windows or MacOS terminology) can contain files of
arbitrary types.  <p>

Some commands allowing a user to manipulate files are:

</p><dl>

<dt> <b> pwd </b>
</dt><dd> displays the name of the current directory (``.'')<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> ls </b>
</dt><dd> lists the files in the current directory<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> ls dir </b>
</dt><dd> lists the files in the directory ``dir''<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> ls </b>
</dt><dd> displays the contents of the current directory; ``ls -lF'' is a useful
   extension providing additional information about the files<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> cp file1 file2 </b>
</dt><dd> copies file1 to file2<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> cd /dir1/dir2 </b>
</dt><dd> go to specified directory; <kbd>cd ..</kbd> means go to the directory
   above the current directory; <kbd>cd ../foo</kbd> means go up one level,
   then down into directory foo.  The current directory is always
   denoted by ``.''<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> mv file1 file2</b>
</dt><dd> rename file1 as file2, within the same directory (changing
   the name of the file), or move file1 into some other directory<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> cat file </b>
</dt><dd> display file onto standard output (the screen, usually)<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> more file </b>
</dt><dd> display file onto standard output (screen), one screenful at a
     time.  For obscure UNIX reasons, the command "less" does much the
     same thing...<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> &gt; </b>
</dt><dt> <b> &gt;&gt; </b>
</dt><dd> redirect output to a file;
	e.g. <kbd> cat file1 &gt; file2 </kbd> copies file file1 into file2,
	and  <kbd> cat file1 &gt;&gt; file2 </kbd> appends file1 onto file2.<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> | </b>
</dt><dd> ``pipe'' standard output to standard input
	e.g. <kbd> cmd1 | cmd2 </kbd> sends the output of command
	cmd1 into the input of cmd2<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> touch file</b>
</dt><dd> updates the ``date and time stamp'' of a file, making it
   believe that it has just been modified<p>

</p></dd><dt> <b> rm file</b>
</dt><dd> delete a file<p>

</p></dd></dl>
<p>

File name completion is supported under csh and tcsh (turn it on by
issuing the command ``set filec.'' In csh, use the ESCAPE key; in
tcsh, use the TAB key. </p><p>

UNIX also supports ``wildcards.''  A ``?''  will be replaced by any
matching single character, while a ``*'' will be replaced by any
number of matching characters.  For example, <kbd> ls abc*.c </kbd>
will list all files whose name starts with ``abc'' and ends in ``.c''.

</p><h2> System Access and Security</h2>

UNIX provides a multi-user computing environment.  This means that it
shares its resources among many users, as well as the various tasks
that each user might be performing.  It also implies that UNIX must
provide a security safegard against users peeking into each others'
``home directories.''
<p>

To gain access to a UNIX system, a user must first identify his/her
account in response to the login prompt,
</p><p>
</p><pre><kbd>	Login:   </kbd> <i> username </i>
<kbd>	Password:</kbd> <i> password </i>
</pre>

then give a unique password. A user can change his/her password by
issuing the command <kbd>passwd</kbd>, followed by the old and new
passwords.  <p>

The user can exit the system with the command <kbd> logout </kbd>.

On login, UNIX starts up a new shell interpreter (e.g. the C-shell
interpreter csh, or bash), and sets up the computing environment for
the user by scanning the ``hidden'' (i.e. not normally listed by ls)
set-up files, <tt>.login</tt> and <tt>.cshrc</tt> (<tt>.orifile</tt>
and <tt>.bashrc</tt> in bash). The <tt>.cshrc</tt> file is also
scanned each time a new ``task'' (e.g. a new window) is launched.
These hidden files are how a user can customize his/her computing
environment at will, typically with commands like
</p><pre>	alias name definition
</pre>
in csh, or
<pre>        alias name=definition
</pre>
in bash, which defines ``name'' (usually something short) to mean
``definition'' (often long and/or complicated).  <p>

Each file is marked for ownership by a user and as belonging to a
group of users.  Each file is also marked for ``reading'', ``writing''
and ``execute'' permissions by its owner, members of its group and by
``others'' The directory command ``ls -l'' lists these permissions as
``r'', ``w'' and ``x'' if they are allowed.  For instance, the
following dialog </p><p>

</p><pre>	&gt; ls -l
	total 6
	-rw-rw-r--  1 steve     4322 Jan 10 12:30 file1
	drwxrwxr-x  2 steve      512 Jan 10 12:29 file2
	&gt; 
</pre>

shows that file1 has can be read and written by the owner and all
group members, and read by all, while file2 is unprotected, except
that it cannot be written by ``others''. Furthermore, file2 is a
directory (name of a sub-directory within the current one -- indicated
by a ``d'' in the first column).   For a full description
of <kbd>ls</kbd> and its options, type '<kbd>man ls</kbd>'.<p>

The protections of a file or group of files can be modified using
the <kbd> chmod </kbd> command.  For example, to make all files whose
names begin with <tt>abc</tt> executable by your group and unreadable
by others, type

</p><pre>	&gt; ls -l abc*
        -rw-r--r--  1 steve  staff   123 Mar 31 10:38 abc1
        -rw-r--r--  1 steve  staff  2331 Mar 31 10:38 abc2
        -rw-r--r--  1 steve  staff     2 Mar 31 10:38 abc34
	&gt; chmod g+x,o-r abc*
	&gt; ls -l abc*
        -rw-r-x---  1 steve  staff   123 Mar 31 10:38 abc1
        -rw-r-x---  1 steve  staff  2331 Mar 31 10:38 abc2
        -rw-r-x---  1 steve  staff     2 Mar 31 10:38 abc34
</pre>

To change the default file permissions, i.e. the permissions applied
to every new file you create, use the <tt>umask</tt> command:

<pre>	&gt; umask 022
        &gt; touch xyz
        &gt; ls -l xyz
        -rw-r--r--  1 steve  staff  0 Mar 31 10:57 xyz
	&gt; umask 026
        &gt; touch pqr
        &gt; ls -l pqr
        -rw-r-----  1 steve  staff  0 Mar 31 10:58 pqr
</pre>

The algorithm is a little obscure: take the number following
the <tt>umask</tt> command, subtract it from 666, and the result is
the user/group/other permissions, in octal!  As a practical matter,
022 gives everyone read permission, 026 denies read access to others
(outside your group), and 066 means that noone else can read or
execute your files.  The <tt>umask</tt> command is normally placed in
your <tt>.login</tt> or <tt>.profile</tt> file, so that it is executed
every time to log in to the system.

<p>The ownership of a file can be modified by the command <kbd>
chown </kbd>; this is a restricted command, however -- it can be
executed only by the system ``super-user.''  </p><p>

</p><p>There are many other commands that facilitate the users'
interaction with the computer in small ways; for instance:
</p><dl>
<dt> <b> date</b>
</dt><dd> gives you the date
</dd><dt> <b> time </b>
</dt><dd> gives you the time
</dd><dt> <b> hostname </b>
</dt><dd> reminds you of the system name
</dd><dt> <b> finger </b>
</dt><dd> gives a list of users and what they are doing
</dd><dt> <b> ps </b>
</dt><dd> display the tasks running on the computer; try <kbd> ps -aux </kbd>
</dd><dt> <b> history </b>
</dt><dd> lists your most recent commands
</dd><dt> <b> !! </b>
</dt><dd> recalls the last command
</dd><dt> <b> !str </b>
</dt><dd> recalls the last command starting with the string str
</dd><dt> <b> !n </b>
</dt><dd> recalls the nth command
</dd></dl>

<p> Help on any UNIX command can be obtained via the <kbd> man </kbd>
command.  The command ``man cmd'' prints to standard output the
content of the manual pages concerning the UNIX command ``cmd''. You
can also search by context with <kbd> man -k cmd </kbd>.  </p><p>

</p><h2> Executing Commands: Running Programs </h2>

A file can be of the special ``executable'' type (e.g. resulting from
a compilation of C code followed by linking to the appropriate
libraries), meaning that it contains instructions for the computer to
execute.  For instance, each UNIX command is itself an ``executable''
residing on the disk in a directory accesible by all. These files are
executed by specifying their name, followed by any necessary
argument. For instance, <p>

</p><pre>	ls -lFg file
</pre>
<p>

will execute the ``ls'' command, with arguments ``-lFfg'' (a switch)
and ``file'', resulting is a very complete directory listing for the
file ``file''. The same goes for any executable file that you might
create.  </p><p>

</p><h2> Automating Tasks: Scripts </h2>

Any set of UNIX commands can be put into a ``script'' file to be
executed all at once as a single command. The language is very
complete, including control structures and looping. As an example,
consider the following script: <p>

</p><pre>#!/bin/csh
#
#          example of a C-shell script
#          --------------------------- 
#
#		store the wordlist resulting from
#		the ls command in variable files
#		
set files = `ls`
#
#		foreach is a loop; files takes on the
#		value of each entry in files
#
#		$variable_name is the content of
#		that variable
#
foreach file ( $files )
      echo 'File name:' $file
end
</pre>
<p>

The script explicitly calls for the C-shell interpreter; the ``set''
command transfers the result of the ls command into the variable
``files'' as a wordlist. Then the ``foreach ...  end'' loops over the
wordlist, assigning each member to the variable ``file''. The command
``echo'' writes a message to standard output. The syntax ``$variable''
means the ``content'' of the variable; $var[i] means the content of
the ith position in the variable.  </p><p>

At the script level, the differences between bash and csh become more
evident.  A bash version of the above script might look like:

</p><pre>#!/bin/bash
#
#          example of a bash script
#          ------------------------
#
#		store the wordlist resulting from
#		the ls command in variable files
#		
files=`ls`
#
#		for is a loop; files takes on the
#		value of each entry in files
#
#		$variable_name is the content of
#		that variable
#
for file in $files; do
      echo 'File name:' $file
done
</pre>
<p>
