</p><h2> Dealing with Data</h2>

This section contains a brief introduction to some of the graphics
tools available on the Drexel Physics computer lab.<p>

Programs--scientific ones, at least--tend to generate lots of data.
You have already seen examples of this in the C-language primer
document, and you will see many more.  Once, you had little choice as
to what you could do with those data.  You could only print it out and
look at it in the form of columns of figures on the screen.  Pretty
dull...!</p><p>

Often, the best way to represent a large dataset is in
<em>graphical</em> form.  At its simplest, this may just mean drawing
simple line graphs.  In more sophisticated contexts, you may end up
making an elaborate 3-D movie, complete with audio track, to
illustrate the Physics and explain your findings to others.  Such
sophisticated visualization is more an art than a science, and usually
calls for specialized hardware and software (although you can actually
get quite far without leaving our lab).  Here, we will confine
ourselves to a discussion of a few basic programs and packages to help
you make simple plots and images from your data.</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="simple">Making Simple Plots</a></h2><a name="simple">

<h3>Drawing a Graph</h3>

Let's begin by describing the steps we must take to plot a simple
graph (e.g. to make a graph of the ``sine'' tabular data produced by
one of the early examples in the C primer).  For the sake of
readibility, and for the convenience of the plotting routines, let's
imagine that the data are written out (to a file or just to
<tt>stdout</tt>) in the form of columns: <tt>x y1(x) y2(x)
...</tt>.  As a reminder, and as a way of generating data for
plotting purposes, </a><a href="http://www.physics.drexel.edu/courses/Comp_Phys/General/Graphics/trig.c">here</a> is a short program that
does what we need:

<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#define N_POINTS 1000
#define XMIN 	 0
#define XMAX 	 (4 * M_PI)	/* this is just 4 PI; M_PI defined in math.h */

main()
{
    int i;
    double x;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; N_POINTS; i++) {
	x = XMIN + i * (XMAX - XMIN) / (N_POINTS - 1);
	printf("%f %f %f\n", x, sin(x), cos(x));
    }
}
</pre>

This will produce 3 columns of data, with 1000 rows in each, listing
the values of x, sin x and cos x, for values of x linearly spaced
between 0 and 4 PI.<p>

In the simplest possible case, to draw a graph of, say sin x versus x
(column 2 versus column 1), we must do the following:

</p><ul>
	<li>read in the data to be plotted from <tt>stdin</tt> or a file
	</li><li>determine the limits of the data
	</li><li>open a graphics device (e.g. an X-window)
	</li><li>draw a set of axes, tick-marks, numbers and labels
	</li><li>determine scaling information to draw the data on the
	    output device
	</li><li>plot the data as points or lines, as desired
</li></ul>

Naturally, X provides all the necessary primitive (low-level)
machinery to do all this, and you can do all your own graphics relying
purely on function calls to the X libraries if you so desire.
However, this is usually quite cumbersome and unpleasant to program.
Instead, we provide several simpler, if more limited, means of
handling graphical data.<p>

</p><h3>The <a name="simple_plot"><tt>simple_plot</tt> library</a></h3><a name="simple_plot">

The <tt>simple_plot</tt> library functions allow you to write a
program using high-level calls to a small set of interface programs,
allowing you to use the X display without first becoming an
``X-pert''.  The interface is kept deliberately simple, making it very
easy to use, but still capable of producing useful, if basic, graphs
and animations.<p>

The following functions are declared in the header file
<tt>simple_plot.h</tt>.  To use these functions, include
<tt>simple_plot.h</tt> in your C program and compile using the system
``<tt>Cgfx</tt>'' command, which will find the proper header files and
use the correct graphics libraries.

</p><p></p><center><table>

</tbody></table></center><p>

Thus, to perform the actions listed above for the sine function, we
can use the following program:

</p><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#include "simple_plot.h"

#define N_POINTS 1000
#define XMIN 	 0
#define XMAX 	 (4 * M_PI)	/* this is just 4 PI; M_PI defined in math.h */

main()
{
    int i;
    double x;

    set_color("black");		/* (this is the default) */

    draw_box(XMIN, XMAX, "x", -1, 1, "sin(x)");
    add_label("plot of sin(x) versus x");

    move_to(XMIN, sin(XMIN));
    set_color("red");
    for (i = 0; i &lt; N_POINTS; i++) {
	x = XMIN + i * (XMAX - XMIN) / (N_POINTS - 1);
	draw_to(x, sin(x));
    }

    exit_graphics();
}
</pre>

The result should look something like:<p>

</p><center><img src="./Graphics Tools_files/simple_plot.gif"></center>

</a><p><a name="simple_plot">An alternative, and in many ways simpler, approach is to use the
``black box'' plotting program <tt>plot_data</tt>, described below,
which contains within it all the knowledge needed to make fairly
complete plots on an X-window display.  The program itself makes calls
to the <tt>lux</tt> interface library written by ex-Drexel graduate
student Biao Lu.  If you are interested in seeing what is involved in
dealing with X at this level, look in the <tt>plot_data</tt> and
<tt>lux</tt> source code (distributed as part of the ``</a><a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~starlab">Starlab</a>'' software package).
In fact, the <tt>simple_plot</tt> library functions are identical to
those used by <tt>plot_data</tt>.</p><p>

</p><h3><a name="plot_data">The program <tt>plot_data</tt></a></h3><a name="plot_data">

The watchwords in programming are flexibility and modularity.
Functions should perform specific, well-defined, simple tasks, without
side effects.  Complexity in a program comes from combinations of
simple tools.  The UNIX embodiment of this philosophy is the notion of
writing programs that operate as <em>filters</em>, acting on a stream
of data that is read from <tt>stdin</tt>, modified in some way, then
(usually) written out to <tt>stdout</tt>. The idea of only using
simple programs joined by pipes may sound terribly limiting, but in
fact it is not.  Remarkably sophisticated packages can be constructed
in this way.  Separating functionality in this way has the added
advantage that we can concentrate on programming the physics without
having to be bothered with the minutiae of the graphics.<p>

The <tt>plot_data</tt> program accepts as input columns of data in
character, integer, or floating-point format.  It selects two columns,
then performs all the operations listed above to produce a graph on
the X-terminal.  If the above program (producing x, sin x and cos x)
has been compiled and called <tt>trig</tt>, then we can plot a graph
of sin x simply by typing

</p><pre>	trig | plot_data
</pre>

You should see something like:<p>

</p><center><img src="./Graphics Tools_files/plot_data_1.gif"></center>

<p>By default, <tt>plot_data</tt> plots column 1 as the x (horizontal)
axis, column 2 as the y (vertical) axis.  Its defaults are selected so
that it does something ``reasonable'' with the minimum of user
input.</p><p>

Suppose we want a graph of cos x instead.  To specify the columns to
plot, use the command-line switch <tt>-c xcol ycol</tt>.  This will
result in <tt>xcol</tt> being plotted as <tt>x</tt>,
<tt>ycol</tt> as <tt>y</tt> (so the default is <tt>xcol = 1, ycol
= 2</tt>).  Thus, we would say:</p><p>

</p><pre>	trig | plot_data  -c 1 3
</pre>

The graph will now look like:<p>

</p><center><img src="./Graphics Tools_files/plot_data_2.gif"></center>

<p>By default, the limits on the x and y axes are taken from the data.
To override this and set your own, use the <tt>-l xmin xmax ymin
ymax</tt> switch, which forces the range on the x-axis to be
<tt>[xmin, xmax]</tt> and that on the y-axis to be <tt>[ymin,
ymax]</tt>.</p><p>

There are several more options to allow you to control the appearance
of your graph.  Here is the complete list.

</p><pre>        -c xcol ycol1 ycol2 ycol3...
                        plot data in xcol horizontally, ycol1, ycol2,
			ycol3,... vertically [1 2]
        -c[c][xy]       crop [x or y] data to plot limits
        -C color1 color2 color3...
                        specify line/point colors for the columns set
			by "-c" [all black]
        -e              echo current settings
        -h header       specify overall label for plot [none]
        -i              ignore inline commands [don't ignore]
        -l xmin xmax ymin ymax  specify limits for plot [get from data]
        -ll             force plot lines only [plot lines]
        -L scale        specify limits to be +/- scale for both axes
        -N nmax         specify maximum number of points to store [50000]
        -o              echo stdin to stdout [do not echo]
        -O xo yo        specify top left corner of plotting box [150, 50]
        -p              toggle plot points only [plot lines]
        -pp             force plot points only [plot lines]
        -P size         specify point size, in x-axis units [0 ==&gt; pixel]
        -q              suppress most output [don't suppress]
        -Q              quit
        -s xs ys        specify box size [500, 500]
        -S skip         skip leading lines [0]
        -t ntrail       specify number of trailing points [infinite]
        -w[w][xy]       wrap [x or y] data to plot limits
        -W              wait for keyboard input [inline only]
        -x xlabel       specify label for x-axis ["column 'xcol'"]
        -X              clear the display and redraw axes [inline only]
        -y ylabel       specify label for y-axis ["column 'ycol1...'"]
        -z zcol         specify column for color data [none]
</pre>

The expressions in square brackets are the defaults.  To get this
list, you can type <tt>plot_data --help</tt>.<p>

Most of the above options are fairly self-explanatory.  One useful
feature of the program is that it can read in several columns of data,
and plot the first on the horizontal axis, all the others vertically.
The <tt>-C</tt> option allows each graph to be plotted in a different
color (specified as standard X color names -- red, blue, green, etc.),
if desired.</p><p>

Alternatively, <tt>plot_data</tt> can read in <em>three</em> columns
of data (x, y, and z, say) and plot y against x, choosing the color of
each point according to the value of the data in z.  The mapping
between z-value and color is presently fairly rudimentary, but
improvements are in the works.</p><p>

The limits for the graphs may be specified on the command line, in
which case <tt>plot_data</tt> draws the axes first and plots points as
they become available, allowing you to see the plot evolve, or to make
animations (<tt>-t</tt> option).  Otherwise, <tt>plot_data</tt> must
determine the limits from the input data, so nothing is plotted until
the entire data stream is read.</p><p>

Some examples (assume that the program <tt>data</tt> produces the
stream of data to plot):

</p><ul>
	<li>To plot column 3 as x, columns 2 and 7 as y, coloring the
	    plots red and green, labeling the x and y axes as "X" and
	    "Y", and setting the limits on the axes to be [-1, 1] and
	    [0, 1]: 
<pre>	data  |  plot_data  -c 3 2 7  -C red green  -x X -y Y  -l -1 1 0 1
</pre>
	</li><li>To plot column 1 as x, column 2 as y (the default),
	    plotting points only and drawing them in red:<p>
</p><pre>	data  |  plot_data  -p  -C red
</pre>
	</li><li>To plot column 4 as x, column 5 as y, making the plot
	    almost fill the entire screen and coloring the data
	    according to the contents of column 7:
<pre>	data  |  plot_data  -c 4 5  -s 800 800  -z 7
</pre>

</li></ul>

<p>Finally, the current version of <tt>plot_data</tt> accepts most of
the above command-line options as <em>embedded commands</em> in the
input data stream itself, allowing the user to exercise run-time
control over the display.  For example, if the command line indicates
that a single column is to be plotted in the vertical direction, and
that the data are to be plotted as lines, then if the data stream
contains
</p><pre>        .
        .
        .
        x  y  z
        x  y  z
        x  y  z
	-C red -p
        x  y  z
        x  y  z
        .
        .
        .
</pre>
the effect of the inline command will be to switch the plot color to
red and to enter point mode.  Subsequent commands might clear the
screen, redefine the axes, change the size of plotted points or the
number of points plotted in ``trail'' mode, and so on.  All commands
except <tt>-i</tt>, <tt>-N</tt>, <tt>-o</tt>, and <tt>-s</tt>
are inlinable.  In addition, some commands only operate in inline
mode: the pause (<tt>-W</tt>) option allows the program to wait for
a keyclick from the user before continuing; and the <tt>-X</tt>
command clears the display and redraws the axes.

<p>In order to to use inline commands, it is necessary that a window
be opened for plotting at the start of input, not at the
end, and this requires that some scaling information be provided on
the command line.  (If no such information is avaliable, then
<tt>plot_data</tt> must obtain limits from the data, so the entire
graph is drawn after the data are read and inline commands are
ignored.)  However, since the limits themselves can be set by inline
commands, all that is really necessary is for <tt>plot_data</tt> to be
forced to open a window, so a simple command like
</p><pre>	plot_data -L
</pre>
will suffice (the default for <tt>-L</tt> is 1).  True limits, labels,
graphs, colors, etc. can then be specified by the program producing
the data.  For example, the plot produced by the first example above
could also be created by having the program <tt>data</tt> print out
the line
<pre>	-c 3 2 7  -C red green  -x X -y Y  -l -1 1 0 1
</pre>
before printing its output, and typing
<pre>	data | plot_data -L
</pre>
on the command line.  This simple technique allows a user to write
remarkably complex graphics programs using nothing more sophisticated
than <tt>printf</tt> statements!

<h3>Getting Hardcopy</h3>

Note that <tt>plot_data</tt>, like the <tt>simple_plot</tt>
functions, only creates graphs in an X-window environment.  It does
<em>not</em> know how to send plots to a printer.  A workaround for
this shortcoming, which results only in rather low-resolution printout
(but that is at least better than no printout at all!), is to use the
<tt>xwd</tt> utility to send a screen dump of the <tt>plot_data</tt>
window to the printer.  A typical sequence of commands would be
<pre>	xwd  |  xpr  |  lpr
</pre>
or possibly
<pre>	convert  x:  ps:-  |  lpr
</pre>
Your cursor will turn into a cross and you will click in the
(<tt>plot_data</tt>) window you want to plot; <tt>xwd</tt> then
creates an X-window dump (bitmap) of the window, <tt>xpr</tt> converts
it to PostScript, and <tt>lpr</tt> prints it.  In the second form, the
<tt>convert</tt> program (available on many systems) converts an X
window directly into PostScript.  In either case, since the printout
is a bitmap scaled to the size of the printed page, the best
resolution  will be obtained by making the <tt>plot_data</tt> window
as large as possible before printing.

</a><h2><a name="plot_data"></a><a name="mcdraw">More Complex Plots: <tt>mcdraw</tt></a></h2><a name="mcdraw">

<tt>plot_data</tt> is very useful and easy to use, but it has many
limitations. For example, it cannot rescale data, do logarithmic
plots, operate outside of an X-window environment, and so on.  A much
more powerful plotting program is <tt>mcdraw</tt>, which operates on
the same data structures as <tt>plot_data</tt> and can perform all
the same operations (and many more), but takes its data only from a
file rather than from <tt>stdin</tt>, so it cannot be used as part
of a pipeline.  However, for many purposes, its other advantages
outweigh this drawback.<p>

Unlike <tt>plot_data</tt>, <tt>mcdraw</tt> prompts the user for
all input data -- filenames, columns to plot, output device (which
doesn't have to be an X-display), and so on -- then draws the graph
and waits for more input.  Its original purpose was to produce
publication-quality plots in a simple fashion.  As a result, it has
better fonts and heuristics for deciding what ``looks right'' than
exist in <tt>plot_data</tt>.  However, it has expanded in scope over
the years, and can now do quite sophisticated operations, such as data
reduction, array arithmetic, curve fitting, among others.</p><p>

A typical <tt>mcdraw</tt> session, to produce a plot similar to the
first example shown above, might look like:

</p><pre>	mcdraw:	file DATA	# open a data file called DATA
	mcdraw:	c 3 2		# get x from column 3, y from column 2
	mcdraw:	lim -1 1 0 1	# set limits on x and y
	mcdraw:	de x		# initialize graphics in X-windows
	mcdraw:	xl X		# specify the x-label as "X"
	mcdraw:	yl Y		# specify the y-label as "Y"
	mcdraw:	box		# draw a box, with labelled axes, etc.
	mcdraw:	plot		# plot y(x)
	mcdraw:	la LABEL	# put an overall label ("LABEL") on the figure.
	mcdraw:	quit		# exit from MCDRAW.
</pre>

The ``#'' means that the rest of the line is a comment.  Commands may
be ruthlessly abbreviated and combined on a single line, separated by
semicolons, so the above command sequence could be equally well
written as:

<pre>	mcdraw:	f DATA; c 3 2; l -1 1 0 1; de x; xl X; yl Y; b; p; q
</pre>

For more information on <tt>mcdraw</tt> and a complete description
of the present command set, see the <tt>mcdraw</tt> </a><a href="http://www.physics.drexel.edu/courses/Comp_Phys/General/Graphics/mcdraw.text">primer</a>.

<h2>Higher-dimensional Data</h2>

<h3> Contours and Surfaces</h3>

Line plots such as those produced by <tt>plot_data</tt> and
<tt>mcdraw</tt> are fine when the dataset consists of a single
independent variable.  However, we very often want to plot datasets in
which the value of some function depends on two (or more) independent
variables.  Visualizing problems with three or more independent
variables is hard, but for two-dimensional problems -- looking at the
data f(x, y), say -- we have a variety of approaches open to us.<p>

One possibility is just to make <em>contour plots</em> of the ``level
lines'' of the dependent function f.  <tt>mcdraw</tt> has a ``2d''
mode which will allow you to do this interactively.  A second
possibility is to make three-dimensional perspective plots of the
surface in (x, y, z space) defined by z = f(x, y).  <tt>mcdraw</tt>
can do this too, in a fairly primitive manner.  A much more
sophisticated 3-D plotting package is <a href="http://www.khoros.unm.edu/khoros"><tt>khoros</tt></a>, a
public-domain X utility.</p><p>

A very commonly used technique for displaying two-dimensional data is
to make an <em>image</em>. This has the considerable advantage of
enlisting the assistance of the many image-display and
image-processing programs that exist in the public domain. In
addition, images can be easily combined to make <em>movies</em> using
the <tt>mpeg_encode</tt> program.</p><p>

</p><h3><a name="image">Images</a></h3><a name="image">

The idea of representing data by an image is very simple.  The data
are calculated on a rectangular grid in x and y, of dimension
<tt>m</tt> by <tt>n</tt>, say.  Each pixel in the final image
represents a point in that grid, and the color assigned to the pixel
represents the value of f at that point.  The mapping between the
value of f and the color assigned is entirely up to the programmer.
Typically it is chosen to enhance or emphasize certain features of
interest in the data.<p>

On our systems, the color resolution of our screens allows us to
display up to 256 colors simultaneously.  The number is chosen because
integers in the range 0 to 255 can be represented using a single byte
of data--an <tt>unsigned char</tt> in C.  Of course, there are many
ways to choose these colors.  The mapping between the integers 0 to
255 and the final color that appears on the display is called a
<em>color map</em>.  The standard color map we use looks like this:</p><p>

</p><center><img src="./Graphics Tools_files/colormap.gif"></center>

<p> There is no particular reason for this choice--it is simply
convenient.  Small numbers correspond to blue, large numbers to red,
and intermediate numbers to intermediate colors in the ``spectrum''.
The programs <tt>mcdraw</tt> and <tt>make_image</tt> (described in
a moment) allow you to change the color map to one of your own, if you
so desire.</p><p>

To X, an image is a collection of bytes, one per pixel, along with a
color map telling the display how to ``paint'' the screen.  There are
many different image formats in use--gif, jpeg, miff, xpn, to name but
a few.  Fortunately, we don't have to know how to construct them all.
The program <tt>convert</tt> allows us to turn one into another.</p><p>

To assist in turning your data into an image, we have provinded a
simple program called <tt>make_image</tt>.  This program takes a
stream of data (fdrom <tt>stdin</tt>) representing your image (scanned
left to right, top to bottom), adds a <em>header</em> describing the
color map (the standard one, by default), and writes the image to
<tt>stdout</tt>.  The data may be float (the default),
<tt>int</tt>, or <tt>char</tt>, and are <em>assumed</em> already to be
scaled to lie in the range 0 to 255.  Thus, to make a simple image,
assuming that <tt>data</tt> produces the correct input, just type:

</p><pre>	data  |  make_image  -s XSIZE YSIZE  &gt; image
</pre>

You must specify XSIZE and YSIZE to tell the <tt>make_image</tt> how
to divide the data string up into rows. The file <tt>image</tt>
produced in this way may be viewed with <tt>xv</tt> or
<tt>display</tt>.<p>

The file created my <tt>make_image</tt> is in so-called ``Sun
rasterfile'' format.  This format has no particular advantage, except
that it is simple and easy to code.  To make, say, a GIF file, use
<tt>convert</tt>: 

</p><pre>	convert  image  image.gif
</pre>

You can also do the conversion in a pipe without creating an
intermediate Sun rasterfile:

<pre>	data  |  make_image  -s XSIZE YSIZE  |  convert - image.gif
</pre>

The full list of <tt>make_image</tt> options is:

<pre>	-c	  incoming data are in char form
	-i	  incoming data are in int form
	-f	  incoming data are in float form [default]
	-m file	  read the colormap from the specified file
	-p	  pad the image to even dimensions (Sun rasterfile limitation)
	-s m n	  specify the dimensions of the image to be m by n
		  If only m is given, take n = m
</pre>

The following simple program produces some sample image data

<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#define N_POINTS 200

main()
{
    int i, j;
    double x, y;

    for (j = 0; j &lt; N_POINTS; j++)
	for (i = 0; i &lt; N_POINTS; i++) {
	    x = 2*i*M_PI/N_POINTS;
	    y = 2*j*M_PI/N_POINTS;
	    printf("%f ", 255*(1 + sin(x)*cos(y)));
	}
}
</pre>

Compile this as <tt>data</tt>, then type

<pre>	data  |  make_image  -s 200  |  xv -
</pre>

and you will see:

<center><img src="./Graphics Tools_files/example.gif"></center>

It's as easy as that!<p>

Sometimes it is desirable to view the results of a calculation in the
form of a <i>sequence</i> of images, showing the time-development of
some system, or perhaps a sequence of steps toward convergence of some
iterative process.  The program <tt>make_images</tt> automates the
operation of </a><a href="http://www.physics.drexel.edu/courses/Comp_Phys/General/Graphics/index.html#image"><tt>make_image</tt></a>, breaking the
input stream into a series of frames and storing the resulting images
in separate files.  The command-line arguments are the same as for
<tt>make_image</tt>, with the additional option

<pre>	-F name	  set the "base" name for image files
</pre>

which defines the base name to be used in naming the output files.
The default is "IMAGE", and successive images are saved in files
IMAGE.0000, IMAGE.0001, etc.

<p>Thus, if the program <tt>data</tt> produces a stream of image data
in the form of 200x200 arrays, typing

</p><pre>	data  |  make_images -s 200 -F TEMP
</pre>

will create a series of files TEMP.0000, TEMP.0001,... containing Sun
rasterfile images derived from the input data.  New image files will
continue to be created until the input data stream terminates.

<p>The image files may be conveniently viewed using the
<tt>animate</tt> utility by typing

</p><pre>	animate  TEMP.*
</pre>
